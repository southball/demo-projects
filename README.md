# Demo Projects

## What is this?

This is a repository containing some small projects to try out different
technologies.

## Why?

Sometimes when I discover technologies that I have not used before, I do not
have idea of how to use these technologies. Making something new would be a way
to learn, but a full project takes too much time.

By limiting the scope to small projects, it is possible to get familiar with new
technologies without spending too much time. It is then possible to combine
these technologies into a larger project in the future.

## List of projects

- `minio-simple`: a project to try out the S3-compatible storage Minio. For some
  reason I have not actually tried using S3-compatible storage in programming.
